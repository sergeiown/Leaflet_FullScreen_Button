# [Leaflet FullScreen Button](https://sergeiown.github.io/Leaflet_FullScreen_Button/)

A Leaflet plugin for creating a button control with the functionality to activate full screen mode. Simple and straightforward. Does not contain anything superfluous except for convenient and necessary options.

The idea came from a small project: [Map_with_Marker_Clusters](https://sergeiown.github.io/Map_with_Marker_Clusters/) during the work on which there was a need to implement a full screen mode but there was no desire to use existing plugins.
